## Limitations
- Some unexpected issues may happen after you scale out your site to multiple instances, if you deploy a WordPress site on Azure with this docker image and use the MariaDB built in this docker image as the database.
- The phpMyAdmin built in this docker image is available only when you use the MariaDB built in this docker image as the database.
- Must include  App Setting ```WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE``` = true  since we need files to be persisted. Do not use local storage for WordPress. You can use local storage for transient data or cached data say /tmp folder.
